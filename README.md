# ⚡ WhatsUp Clients

**WhatsApp Desktop, without the browser inside it.**

A native WhatsApp client written in Go: no WebView, no Electron, no Chromium.
It aims to look and feel like the official app while using a small fraction of its memory.

## Why?

The official desktop app is a whole web browser running one web page. WhatsUp Clients draws
its own UI on the GPU with [Gio](https://gioui.org) and talks to WhatsApp directly through
[hypermeow](https://github.com/polymorfa/hypermeow), a performance-focused fork of
whatsmeow. You get the same app, pixel for pixel where it matters, in one small executable.

- **Native and light.** One Go binary. Caches are capped by size, and after ten idle seconds
  the app hands memory back to the OS.
- **Familiar.** Layouts, sizes and colors are measured against screenshots of the real app,
  so nothing needs relearning.
- **Local.** Messages are kept in a SQLite file on your computer.
- **Stays in the tray.** Closing the window frees its GPU memory, and the connection keeps
  running so notifications still arrive.

### Things WhatsApp doesn't do

These are all **off until you turn them on** in *Settings > Extra features*. They only use what
WhatsApp already lets every linked device do, and they run from your own account.

    <td><b>Slash commands, like Discord.</b> Type <code>/</code> to manage a group you run without opening a single menu.</td>
    <td><b><code>/calc</code></b> works out the answer as you type and picks up the amounts in the message you reply to. Splitting a bill takes one line.</td>

    <td><img src="docs/screenshots/edits.png" alt="Edit history"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b><code>/schedule</code></b> sends a message later, even with the window closed. <b><code>/afk</code></b> replies for you while you're away.</td>
    <td><b>Edit history</b> shows what an edited message said before each edit.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="docs/screenshots/privacy.png" alt="Privacy mode"></td>
    <td><img src="docs/screenshots/ghost.png" alt="Ghost mode"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Privacy mode</b> for when others can see your screen: names and messages turn into bars and pictures blur until you point at them. Ctrl+Shift+P or the eye in the title bar. <b>Block screen recording</b> keeps the window out of captures.</td>
    <td><b><code>/ghost</code></b> reads chats and statuses invisibly: no read receipts, shown offline, and nothing sent from you until you turn it off.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

A page of its own, *Ethically gray features*, holds the ones that show more than the sender
meant you to see. Each has its own switch:

- 🗑️ **Keep deleted messages** keeps messages and statuses deleted for everyone, marked Deleted.
- 👁️ **Replay view once** opens view once messages as often as you like, screenshots allowed.
- 👻 **`/ghost`** and ✏️ **Edit history**, above.

Turning one on opens a warning about privacy expectations. You must check the acknowledgment
and choose **Enable feature** before it is activated. Turning it off is immediate; turning it
back on asks again.

<details>
<summary><b>All the slash commands</b></summary>

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/add <contact>` | Adds people to the group |
| `/kick <member>` | Removes members from the group |
| `/promote <member>` / `/demote <member>` | Makes members admins, or dismisses admins |
| `/link` | Shows the group's invite link |
| `/lockdown on\|off` | Lets only admins send messages, or everyone again |
| `/description <text>` | Changes the group description |
| `/sticker top text#bottom text` | Turns a photo into a sticker, meme text included |
| `/purge <count>` | Deletes your last messages for everyone |
| `/raffle <winners>` | Draws group members at random and announces them |
| `/calc <sum>` | A calculator: `12 x 4500`, `15k x 3`, `15% x 80000` |
| `/schedule <when> <message>` | Sends later: `21:00`, `2h`, `tomorrow 08:00`, `fri 18:00` |
| `/scheduled` | Lists the chat's scheduled messages, to send now or cancel |
| `/afk <reason>` | Auto-replies while you're away, until you send something |
| `/ghost` | Goes invisible: no read receipts, shown offline, no sending (an ethically gray feature) |
| `/snippet send <name>` | Sends a saved message; the picker over the composer offers them as you type |
| `/snippet save [name]` | Saves the whole message you reply to (a poll, document or photo too), under that name or a generated one |
| `/catch` | Opens the stored payload of the message you reply to, with Copy JSON and Export JSON |

Manage saved messages in **Settings > Snippets**: search, add text or message JSON,
edit, rename, and delete. Snippets belong to the current account. Their text (and a
payload's text and captions) can use variables, filled in when you send: `{name}` (the
contact, or in a group the author of the message you reply to), `{first}`, `{mention}`
(@mentions the author of the message you reply to; without a reply, the chat by its name,
like `@admin` but notifying no one), `{chat}`,
`{me}`, `{quote}`, `{greeting}`, `{date}`, `{time}` and `{day}`. Unknown `{...}` stays as
it is, and `\{name}` sends `{name}` literally. Saving a media snippet downloads a separate
copy for reuse; sending it uploads that copy again. A snippet sent while you reply goes as a reply.

`/catch` shows a local result; it does not send the payload to the chat. Raw payloads
are stored in the existing message database for newly received, synced, and outgoing
messages. Older messages may not have one. JSON includes fields understood by the
pinned protocol schema; unknown protobuf fields remain in the database. An edited
message exposes its latest available edit content. Deleted payloads follow the
existing deletion preferences, and view once export requires Replay view once.

Group commands work in groups where you're an admin. You'll also find **`@admin`**, which
mentions every admin of a group at once, and **Raw quality**, which sends JPEG and PNG
photos exactly as they are.

## Download

Prebuilt packages for **Windows** (amd64) and **Linux** (amd64) are on the
[Releases](https://github.com/latiefahmad/whatsupclients/releases) page and attached to every CI run.

- `WhatsUpClients-Setup.exe` installs the app for your user only. It doesn't need admin rights.
- `WhatsUpClients-windows-amd64.exe` is the same app without an installer.

To update, use **Settings > Help > Check for updates**, which installs the new release in place.
See [docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md) for how releases are made and signed.

## Try it without an account

Want to look around first? The demo mode starts the app with made-up chats and no network.
All the screenshots above come from it.

```sh
go run ./cmd/whatsup -demo
```

## Build from source

You need the Go version in `go.mod`. On Linux, first install Gio's
[system dependencies](https://gioui.org/doc/install/linux).

```sh
sh patches/apply.sh            # once after cloning: builds the patched go-text (see patches/)
go run ./cmd/whatsup            # run the app and link it with a QR code
go run ./cmd/whatsup -demo      # made-up chats, no network
go run ./cmd/whatsup -debug     # log protocol traffic
go run ./cmd/whatsup -background  # start in the tray, without a window
go build ./...
```

Your session and messages are stored in `%AppData%\WhatsUpClients\whatsup.db` on Windows,
and in the user config directory on other platforms.

## How it fits together

```
cmd/whatsup/        the desktop app
cmd/screenshot/    renders the UI headlessly to PNG, or next to a real WhatsApp screenshot
cmd/memprobe/      memory and frame-time benchmark (Windows)
internal/model/    what the UI sees: chats, messages, events, and the Backend interface
internal/ui/       the Gio interface, from the chat list to the photo editor
internal/wa/       hypermeow backend and the SQLite message store
internal/mock/     the demo backend
internal/command/  slash commands
internal/auto/     scheduled messages and AFK replies
internal/sticker/  makes stickers, with its own small lossless WebP encoder
internal/video/    plays video and audio with the OS's decoder
internal/notify/   system notifications
internal/desktop/  tray icon, start at login, single instance
internal/update/   signed self-updates
```

The UI never touches protocol types. `internal/wa` turns hypermeow events into
`internal/model` events, and the UI drains them on its own goroutine, so UI state needs no locks.

## Contributing

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before changing code. It covers the conventions, the gotchas
found in the pinned Gio version, and the screenshot tooling used to match WhatsApp Desktop.
Low memory use is the reason this project exists, so measure with `cmd/memprobe` before and
after a change. Run `gofmt`, `go vet ./...` and `go build ./...` before you send it.
