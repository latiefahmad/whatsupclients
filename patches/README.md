# Dependency patches

`typesetting.patch` patches go-text (`github.com/go-text/typesetting`, Gio's
text library) to use far less memory for fonts. `go.mod` replaces the module
with `third_party/typesetting`, which `apply.sh` builds from the Go module
cache and is not checked in:

```sh
sh patches/apply.sh
```

Run it after cloning, and again when the patch or the go-text version in
`go.mod` changes. Until then the build fails with "replacement directory
./third_party/typesetting does not exist".

What the patch does (each change is marked `WhatsUpClients patch`):

- `font/opentype/tables/glyphs_glyf_src.go` and its users in `font/`: glyphs
  are parsed on demand. Upstream parses a font's whole `glyf` table when it
  loads, about ten times the table size in heap (17 MB for MS Gothic).
- `font/opentype/bytes.go`, `reader.go`: a `BytesReader` resource returns
  tables as subslices instead of copies (the bundled fonts, see
  `internal/ui/fonts.go`).
- `fontscan/mmap*.go`, `footprint.go`: system fonts are memory-mapped
  (copy-on-write) instead of read into the heap.

To move to another go-text version (Gio decides which one it needs), change
`go.mod`, run `apply.sh`, fix any rejected hunks in `third_party/typesetting`,
and regenerate the patch from a clean copy of the new version:

```sh
cd "$(mktemp -d)" && cp -R "$(go env GOMODCACHE)/github.com/go-text/typesetting@<version>" ts &&
    chmod -R u+w ts && cd ts && git init -q && git add -A && git commit -qm upstream &&
    cp -R <repo>/third_party/typesetting/. . && git add -A &&
    git diff --cached > <repo>/patches/typesetting.patch
```
